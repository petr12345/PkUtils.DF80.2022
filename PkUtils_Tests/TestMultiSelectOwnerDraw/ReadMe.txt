TestMultiSelectOwnerDraw
--------------------------------------

Project TestMultiSelectOwnerDraw demonstrates a specialized TreeView control MultiSelectOwnerDrawTreeView,
that extends multi-selection functionality of base MultiSelectTreeView with owner-drawn rendering. 

The control MultiSelectOwnerDrawTreeView not only supports selection of multiple nodes 
via keyboard and mouse interactions, but also provides custom visual indications for nodes 
that are descendants of selected nodes (projected selections). 
The project serves to test and showcase the owner-drawing capabilities and visual enhancements added 
on top of the basic multi-selection features.

The purpose of this project is to validate and illustrate an advanced TreeView component that offers both 
multi-selection and rich visual feedback for complex hierarchical selection scenarios — functionality not available 
in the standard Windows Forms TreeView control.
