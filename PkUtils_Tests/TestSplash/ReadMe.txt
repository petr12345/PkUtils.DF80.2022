This  TestSplash.*.csproj prototype demonstrates  implementation and usage of the SplashScreen,
with several advanced features, following the CodeProject article
"A Pretty Good Splash Screen in C#"  by Tom Clement

However, the original code has been modified several times.
For the complete list of changes, see the comments in the source SplashForm.cs
