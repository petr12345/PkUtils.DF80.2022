Standard Right-Click Behavior in Windows Controls
=========================================================

In standard Windows controls like TreeView and ListView, 
the default behavior when right-clicking on an item depends on a few factors. 
Here’s a summary of the standard expected behavior based on the native Windows UI conventions:

✅ Default Behavior (No Modifier Keys Pressed):
--------------------------------------------------
a/ If the right-clicked item is not selected:
→ The item becomes selected (and other selections are cleared).
→ The item receives focus.
→ The context menu (if any) will typically apply to this single item.

b/ If the right-clicked item is already selected:
→ The selection does NOT change; that includes multi-selection.
→ The context menu applies to the currently selected group.

Note: Case (b) intentionally differs from left-click behavior, which typically alters selection.
Note: This behavior aligns with standard Windows UI patterns, such as those in Windows Explorer.

✅ With Ctrl Key Pressed:
--------------------------------------------------
The Ctrl key is generally used for multi-selection, 
but Windows does NOT modify right-click behavior based on Ctrl in most cases.
Right-clicking while Ctrl is held typically behaves the same as right-clicking without it:

- If you right-click an unselected item, it becomes the only selected item, regardless of Ctrl.
- If you right-click a selected item, selection stays unchanged.

❌ Deselecting Items on Right-Click:
--------------------------------------------------
Right-click should not deselect items directly.
Deselecting usually only occurs as a side-effect when right-clicking on a new, 
unselected item, because the selection switches.
