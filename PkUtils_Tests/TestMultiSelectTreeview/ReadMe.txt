TestMultiSelectTreeView 
--------------------------

Project TestMultiSelectTreeView demonstrates an enhanced TreeView control supporting multi-selection of nodes, 
including keyboard and mouse interactions, visual highlighting, and handling nodes with and without images.
The purpose of this project is to test and showcase an extended TreeView class, 
offering features that are not natively supported by the standard Windows Forms TreeView control.
