/// <para>
/// Using the generics approach, you can make just any class countable without the request to
/// derive it from a particular base class ( which is not possible if the class needs to derive
/// from other base class, since multiple inheritance is not supported by C# or rather by .NET
/// ).<br/>
/// </para> </summary>
/// 
/// <typeparam name="T"> The class that you want to make countable. </typeparam>
/// 
/// <remarks>
/// Besides the multiple inheritance issue, unfortunately there is another problem with generics
/// approach, since in C# (unlike in C++) one cannot specify the base class the generic could
/// derive from. So, the code like following produces compilation error <i>"Cannot derive from 'R'
/// because it is a type parameter"</i> <br/>
/// <code>
/// <![CDATA[
///   public class CountableGeneric<T, R> : R
/// ]]>
/// </code>
/// Therefore, you cannot derive your generic from the other class provided as type argument;
/// but at least you could inherit from generic base class, with self as type parameter.
/// This approach is called "Curiously recurring templates/generics pattern". <br/>
/// Code example:
/// <code>
/// <![CDATA[
///   public class GGG : CountableGeneric<GGG>
///   {
///     ...
///   }
